                Hello my name is Todor Enikov. I am studying in Telerik Academy. I am participating in the last course in the Academy and it is called ASP .NET MVC. I would like to finish the training in the Academy, but We will see what Viktor thinks about that. :) :D
                Here is a <a href="http://telerikacademy.com/Users/Enikov">link</a> to my profile in the Telerik Academy System, if you want to learn something more about me. :)
